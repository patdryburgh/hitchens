The next day.

"I'm going to enter."

Cliffman said, sounding determined.

Even though he said that, he was still having trouble with the entry form right now.

Ellen and Harriet had already submitted their participation applications. Both of them knew that the other had applied for Miss Temple and the Open Tournament respectively.

"Just close your eyes and do it."

"W-when I try to write, my eyes start tearing up…"

In the lobby of the dorm, Cliffman was a wreck while focusing on a piece of paper, and I was trying to convince him to just make up his mind and fill up the damn thing.

After a while, Liana de Grantz, who was walking by, walked up to us.

"What are you guys doing?"

"Oh, he, he... He..."

Cliffman stuttered as Liana suddenly spoke to him. He's especially weak to girls who are blunt. Ellen does it to him, and Liana does it too, though in a different way.

In fact, Liana speaks to everyone bluntly. She'll treat everyone the same, and she's not shy about it either.

Cliffman stammered, unable to answer at all, so I finally spoke up.

"Mister Temple, we’re participating."

"You…?"

Liana frowned at that. She looked like she heard something wrong.

No, you didn’t hear it wrong. But it’s not me.

"Only Cliffman is entering, not me."

"... Him?"

"...."

Typical response, as expected. Cliffman, you poor bastard.

But wow, really.

Him?

This guy?

You have a way with words, asshole.

Cliffman looked like he'd been caught in the middle of an ill-conceived nightmare. Liana sat down across from him and stared into his face.

"Hmm."

She made a considering sound

Liana didn't ask anything about why he'd participate, or whether he should or shouldn't.

She just stared and seemed to think about something.

"That, that... That... Is that too much... Ah, aha. Ahhhhh…."

Cliffman scratched his head and reached for the application, thinking that she disapproved.

This is not working after all.

-Tap!

"Ugh."

But Liana slapped his hand away.

"Give him to me."

"Uh, huh?"

"Why are you worrying so much and getting worked up about something as trivial as this?"

Liana looked like she's having fun.

Come to think of it, strictly speaking, the real delinquent of class A is this gal.

![Image]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/illustrations/Ch-280.jpg)

She coasts by through sheer talent, and she comes from a wealthy family so she spends money like it's nothing. Now that it's the exam period, she usually complains that she's being forced to study by Ellen, Adelia, and Harriet.

It was clear that she would not miss out on such an amusing development.

Liana started filling out the application, including Cliffman's name and class.

"When's your birthday?"

"Uh, well, it's......."

"Quickly."

"June 18th......."

"Height and weight."

She filled out Cliffman's application for him and held it out for his signature.

"Sign it."

"Huh?"

"Sign it? This is for you."

"That, that....... I, uh, I'm not quite ready for that......."

Liana's brow narrowed.

"Just do it. Do you want to get electrocuted? Do you want to get crispy?"

-Flick! Flick!

Liana's fingertips glowed blue, and Cliffman signed his signature in horror.

Liana, you asshole.

She knows exactly how to handle Cliffman.

Does she know that indecisive, moody kids need to be dragged by the scruff of the neck?

No, that’s just the way she is. When Liana received the signed application, she scratched her head.

"Does this have to be submitted by me?"

"Well, it's... Uh, I don't know about that...."

"I think you should go."

Liana nods at my words.

"There's no reason why someone shouldn't go with me, right?"

"I suppose?"

-Tuck

Liana stood up from her seat and tapped Cliffman on the shoulder.

"Hey, come with me."

"Eh, eh?"

"You don’t understand?. Do you really want to get electrocuted?"

"Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, okay!"

Cliffman bounced to his feet, and Liana led the way, application in hand.

"Your looks are okay, but you can’t do anything properly. You’re so troublesome."

Liana led the way, but Cliffman was staring at me.

Help me! Please!

He had a look on his face that said that.

No....

Even if you beg… I can't do anything about it.

Like a cow being led to the slaughter, Cliffman reluctantly trudged behind Liana.

When Liana returned, she brought him back with a look of triumph on her face.

Apparently, he had submitted the application.

"Hmm...."

"Uh... Why are you doing this again?"

"First of all, you look so nerdy. Your hair, your expression, your posture, your whole demeanor."

Cliffman's expression was momentarily stunned by Liana's blunt remark.

After sitting Cliffman down, Liana started playing with his hair, pushing it back and forth with her hands, and messing up his hair.

Oh yeah, that's right…

She loved to dress up and stuff.

It was like she was going to do what she did with Ellen on the island, only this time it was with Cliffman. It doesn't matter if it's a man or a woman, as long as it's a good hanger, huh?

Of course, Cliffman was squirming under Liana's touch, his heart thundering furiously with each skin contact.

"Mmm... Something's missing...."

What the hell, it seemed like the whole Mister Temple-making operation had slipped out of my hands?

"Anyway, you should trust your sister."

"Uh? Uh, yeah... But why do you call yourself 'sister'."

"Just do it. Go with the flow."

"Ah, okay, got it!”

Is it supposed to be like this?

It seemed like the male Reinhardt's project had passed on to the female Reinhardt's hands.

Suddenly, without my urging or coaxing, Liana started messing with Cliffman.

Even if I tried to add something, Liana took control, saying, "What do you know?" and shooed me away.

"Uh, ah, okay!"

Cliffman gave me a resentful gaze, and a slight sense of guilt crept up on me, but no matter how much I thought about it, between an evil person named Reinhardt and an evil person named Liana de Grantz, the latter seemed more likely to turn Cliffman into Mister Temple.

I mean, she's the one who actually cares about clothes, and she's probably better at taking care of her appearance than I am.

So, in the end, I didn't have a say, and the more talented guy got the job, so I didn't even have to bother.

That wasn't the end of it. While Cliffman and Liana were bickering, Ellen spotted Liana in the distance and shot up to her.

I haven't seen her move that fast in a long time.

"Liana."

"Oh, Ellen, what's up?"

"I want to buy a dress. Do you think you can help me pick one out?"

"A dress? All of a sudden?"

"Yeah."

Ellen nodded.

"I, will participate in Miss Temple."

"...What?"

Liana was stunned for a moment.

Why would she say that?

Astonishment. Doubt..

"Oh. Ohhhh!"

And excitement.

Between these two hangers, she had unlimited dressing opportunities!

"Great! Both of you, come to my room! No, come to my mansion this weekend, both of you! I'll call all the boutiques in the capital!"

Cliffman in her left hand, Ellen in her right.

Liana de Grantz is on the peak of happiness.



* * *



Liana didn't ask any questions about Cliffman and Ellen's spur-of-the-moment decision to participate.

She just seemed to be excited about the idea of trying things on, and didn’t look at the mouth of the gifted horse.

I let her do her thing. I don't really know much about fashion or whatever, my job is just to finalize the elected candidate through [Revision]. If Liana does a good job, it will reduce the points needed for [Revision].

But now there was a variable called Ellen.

It wouldn't be a bad idea for Ellen to be Miss Temple. Olivia and Ellen are both very talented.

Honestly, I wouldn’t mind getting any of their talents, but the most important thing to get is Cliffman's [Combat] talent.

But...

Ellen and Olivia.

If I vote for one of them, the person I vote for should win.

If I vote for Ellen and Olivia wins, I end up with nothing.

And....

Honestly, the odds are clearly in Olivia's favor. All considerations aside, her fame is on a different level.

However, Ellen said she only needed one vote.

So Ellen is going out knowing that she has little chance of being crowned Miss Temple.

"...."

Damn it.

Headaches are a dime a dozen, and they don't go away, they just keep increasing. From existential threats to personal relationships.

The problems just keep coming.

Because it's the exam period, the mood of the first year of Royal Class has changed a lot. It's not just because of the exam period though.

It's because of the new Dorm Supervisor, Saviolin Turner.

"Reinhardt, Lady Turner asked us to gather the students who want to take swordsmanship lessons!"

An excited Ludwig had just arrived at the A-class dormitory. Even though it was the exam period, she was going to give lessons.

"Of course you're coming, right?"

"...Shouldn’t you be thinking about something else?"

It's not my place to say, I have other things to worry about but you should be studying, you asshole!

At my words, Ludwig laughed and scratched his head.

"Yeah, but this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, you know? You never know when it’ll come again.”

He had a point. Ludwig is interested in improving his combat skills, not in studying.

"Anyway, pass the word to A-class, they're going to be giving lessons in the B-class dormitories!"

After passing the message, Ludwig  takes off like a bird, flying back to the B class dormitory.

...I always wondered why he was so weird.

If I was going to be around him more than I had too, I think I’d cry. Even though I'm the one who made him to be like that. I sighed and went around  the rooms of the A-class dormitory, relaying Saviolin Turner's message.

I was no different than Ludwig after all. I'd rather be in Saviolin Turner's swordsmanship lessons than review for the exam.



* * *



We gathered in the B-class dormitory's training hall, even though it was the exam period.

It's just me and Erich from Class A.

Erich seems to be trying harder these days, but I'm not sure about his achievements.

Cliffman really wanted to come, but he was dragged away by Liana.

Ellen seemed to want to come, but was equally concerned about Miss Temple and her preparations with Liana.

From Class B came Scarlett, Ludwig, and Delphine Isadra.

Delphine wasn’t a swordswoman, but she's learning swordsmanship on the side, so she's curious to see what the famous Shanapell Commander, Saviolin Turner, has to teach her.

Saviolin Turner didn't act like she knew me when she came into the dormitory.She's here for Charlotte's protection.

If something happened, she'd look for me, but she didn't even acknowledge me, just nodded at my greeting and walked past me.

I know it's to protect me, but it's also kind of sad.

Oh, sorry to ignore you.

Oh well.

But I don't want you to get in trouble if I openly admit I know you.

I'm sorry....

Of course, the stern look on her face says it all.

"It is fortunate that you could have gathered here today, even though it’s the exam period.."

Then, as if to declare an end to niceties, she pulled a training sword from its sheath.

It was a shame that Ellen, the real ace, wasn't here.

I wondered what Saviolin Turner would think of Ellen's performance, but this wouldn't be her only chance.

In fact, Saviolin Turner seemed a bit puzzled by Ellen's absence. She just didn’t show it.

"I don’t like talking, and I'm not used to teaching things. So if you want to learn from me, you'll have to learn by doing. Those who realize a lot will learn a lot, and those who don't know what they're doing wrong won’t get anything."

Saviolin Turner swept her gaze over the five gathered students.

"Come forward, one by one, starting with those confident of their skills."

"I'll do it!"

Ludwig eagerly stepped forward.

"What's your name?"

"Ludwig, number B-11!"

Saviolin Turner.

Ludwig.

After the original Gate Incident, they became teacher and student.

Saviolin Turner was a harsh and cruel teacher, and Ludwig was forced to get used to her unforgiving and spartan teaching methods, even though they were very painful.

She also taught Ellen, but she was more hands-on with Ludwig than with Ellen. Of course, that doesn't mean she didn't teach Ellen anything.

Ludwig and Saviolin Turner.

Although unintentional, my actions succeeded in bringing them together more than a year earlier than the original timeline.

After the Gate, humanity was in danger and so, Saviolin Turner treated Ludwig harshly, as one of its hopes. But now things are currently fine.

Could they build a softer, more moderate teaching relationship?

"I'm coming!"

"You don't have to be so loud."

"Yes! Got it!"

"I said you don't have to yell."

"Yes!"

"You're ... Do whatever you want."

-Kagak!

Saviolin Turner managed to deflect Ludwig's blade, which he swung with all his might, with just her right hand, and in one swift motion, she brought the tip of her sword to Ludwig's throat.

"Ouch."

"Hmm...."

Saviolin Turner looked at Ludwig and shook her head.

"That was bad."

"I'm sorry!"

"Nothing to be sorry about. It's just the truth."

"I'll do my best!"

"...."

Saviolin Turner stares at Ludwig, who stares back.

‘Hmm....’

‘Uh....’

'I wonder why....'

'I don't like him.’

As expected, I heard Turner’s heart.
