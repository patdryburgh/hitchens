chapter: 275



---


Charlotte's supernatural ability is currently safe, but it is uncertain when they will become dangerous again.

In addition, Saviolin Turner, even in her best condition, would struggle to keep up with her.

So, just in case, the imperial family has sent her nearby, to deal with the situation if Charlotte’s supernatural ability goes out of control again..

But that's not the main reason why she's staying in the dorms instead of the Spring Palace, there's another hidden reason.

Me.

Charlotte staying in the dormitory is to enable me to intervene in case of an emergency, as well as to prevent me from being exposed to Bertus.

Being a Dormitory Supervisor isn't a bad job, of course, but it's a strange transition from First Knight of the Empire to suddenly being a Temple Dormitory Supervisor.

It was the conclusion that the emperor came to, for the safety of the First Princess  and for dealing with her potential rampages.

Those who know the situation would understand.

Bertus and Charlotte seemed to have known this was coming, and I found it to be the right move, if a bit out of the blue.

The safety of the First Princess is such an important matter that Saviolin Turner has been temporarily relieved of her duties as Knight Commander.

“The Commander of Shanapell?”

“Why on earth?”

Those who knew about Saviolin Turner were all bewildered. They all seemed unable to understand this situation.

Who would easily accept this situation? If you don't know about the real situation, you might think it's a strange April Fool's joke.

Except for Ellen Artorius, who had a sullen expression over there saying, 'I should have eaten a bit more this morning...'

Standing between Mr. Epinhauser and Mr. Mustrang was Saviolin Turner, who had stripped down to a two-piece suit and removed her Templar uniform.

“You can just call me Teacher. I can also oversee your personal training if you require it."

At the mention of being trained by the strongest knight in the world, the interested students' eyes began to sparkle.

The most obvious among them was Ludwig, who, just like the others, didn't know anything else but had an excited expression.

* * *

Originally, there was no Dormitory Supervisor for each year. There were homeroom teachers for each year, and they were responsible for being on watch and patrolling.

However, Saviolin Turner is in a rather unique position as a Dormitory Supervisor unique to the first year.

Her interest was, of course, in Class B where Charlotte was, so she didn't pay much attention to Class A.

Aside from the event of the newly arrived Dormitory Supervisor.

The final exams period has begun.

After the comprehensive test that was held on Monday, there were many students who were chatting during the remaining time.

"Aren't you looking forward to the festival?"

Of course, Kono Lint and the other two idiots seemed to be full of excitement for the festival.

"What exactly are they doing for the festival?"

Was Erich's response.

"Isn't there a beauty contest!"

... Well, that's what you would look forward to.

They think that event alone added a lot of value to the festival.

The official names of the contests were Miss Temple and Mister Temple.

They were also going to host a cross-dressing competition too.

They were also supposed to hold the interclass matches, but since the disbandment of the Orbis Class, we only had the final exams to worry about. .

I know the student council were trying their best but even then, there weren't any replacement events that would take up our time.

So this time, the Royal Class didn’t really have to prepare for anything. We were free to just enjoy the festival to its fullest

"Reinhardt."

"Yeah, what's up?"

Kono Lint was so excited, he even spoke to me.

"Aren't you going to join the tournament?"

"Tournament?"

"Well... you're good enough to be in the top ranks, aren't you? They're taking applications starting today."

The tournament, which includes the entire student body from Temple, will be held even though the interclass matches have been canceled.

There are tournaments for each year, and an unlimited class tournament regardless of the year.

Originally, I didn’t want to participate because there was little chance of me being first.

[(Festival) Unlimited Tournament Winner - 15,000 points]

[(Festival) 1st Grade Tournament Winner - 10,000 points]

However, the rewards given by the system were very high.

Since the Orbis class had been closed, the possibility of those guys participating is very low, and even if they do participate, I have awakened my Magic Body Strengthening and Self-Suggestion had grown stronger.

Self-Suggestion and Magic Body Strengthening.

Practically speaking, there is no one who can beat me except for Ellen in my current state. Of course, I have to assume that Magic Body Strengthening will be allowed  in the tournament format.

My abilities were particularly useful in actual combat, but can I use Magic Body Strengthening in a sanctioned tournament?

It worked well in the Spring Palace, though.

Ellen said she didn't want to participate last time because she was so sure she was going to win.

Although there were still  final exams on the horizon.

I think it's alright to participate in the tournament this time.

Regardless of achievement points, if you win in the tournament, you can receive a prize from the emperor along with the trophy.

"Well, should I try then?"

The three idiots looked at me.

They usually leveled a respectful gaze at me these days.

Of course, there was something I needed to confirm before that.

"Hey, Ellen."

"What?"

I approached Ellen who was sitting in the front row.

"I'm going to participate in the first grade tournament."

"Yes."

"Don't participate."

"Yes."

Ellen nodded her head coolly.

With this, was my victory assured?

The gaze of the three idiots looking at me changed.

That bastard. He's manipulating the odds.

It was a look that said that. 

No, if Ellen competes, even if I die and come back to life, I didn’t have a chance in hell!

I don't need second or third place! If it's not first place, I won't get anything! I didn’t even need the prize money! I had to stop this variable somehow!

With one word, I prevented the strongest candidate for victory from participating.

It's a bit of a cheat, but...

Ellen stared at me and said as if it was an afterthought.

"If you can't win, you're going to get it."

"No! Last time you told me to go only up to the quarterfinals!"

"The situation has changed."

It seems that Ellen's standard for me has become much higher than before.

Because my combat potential rose, her standards rose along to match it!

My unexpected declaration of participation.

The strongest rivals, the Orbis Class students, would have been relocated to the general classes at its disbandment.

I don't know if those guys will come out.

But as long as Ellen was not there, the fact that I am a strong candidate for victory does not change.

It suddenly became like this.

"By the way, is there anyone from our class who is going to participate in  Miss Temple?"

You bastard.

You have to speak a little quieter if you want to whisper. Everyone can hear you.

Harriet and Liana threw a contemptuous look at Kono Lint.

You should realize that you're a flesh-eating bastard in a different sense than I am?

"Oh, no! I just... I thought maybe we shouldn't all go watch..."

Just don’t talk.

-Bam!

"Reinhardt!"

And then.

Suddenly, Olivia Lanze appeared, opening the door to the first year classroom.

No, why are you even here! It’s the exam period and you’re not even studying?! Olivia suddenly appeared and ran towards me without caring about everyone's reactions, handing me a piece of paper. I was stunned when I saw what was written on it.

[Miss Temple Contest Application]

It was clearly written there.

"Junior, I'm going to participate in Miss Temple!"

"...What's this?"

"Of course, You’ll vote for me, won't you?"

Miss Temple Contest Application.

What is this noble lady thinking of participating in?

"Ah, ah! Why are you bothering me to go?!"

What should I do if she talks to me like that! She even grabbed my face and tried to shake it, making me feel disgusted as I tore myself away.

No way.

The children's gazes were getting weirder again.

Right here in the classroom, the mood became strange.

That's the feeling I got.

When I forcibly separated from her, Olivia quickly looked around the crowded classroom.

"Hmm, it seems like I have no competitors here."

"...."

"...."

"...."

Liana, Ellen, and Harriet's expressions turned eerie.

Why is she suddenly starting a fight? That was what their expression said.

No, why are you suddenly coming here and provoking us?

Olivia laughed as she saw the disgusted faces of her juniors due to her excessive remarks.

And then suddenly walked somewhere.

To the front row.

She went right beside Ellen.

"You're not going to participate, are you?"

At the sudden provocation, Ellen glared at Olivia.

"Why would I participate in something like that?"

Olivia covered her mouth and looked down at Ellen.

"...Do you think you'll lose?"

"What?"

"Do you think you'll definitely lose even if you joined?"

No! Why do you keep saying that to the kid who's always quiet!

Leave her alone!

I wanted to hit Olivia, who was smiling challengingly, at the back of the head. At that moment when I was about to go and say something.

Something happened.

-Crack!

"Ah!"

Ellen stood up and grabbed Olivia's collar.

![Image]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/illustrations/Ch-275.jpg)

The faces of the children who saw the scene were filled with astonishment, and so was mine.

The lid had been opened.

Ellen grabbed Olivia's collar with a stern expression.

"I don't know why you’re always like this to me, but please leave. I don't want to deal with you."

"Are you... trying to stop a senior... from winning now...?"

Just as I was about to step in, another thing happened.

-Boom!

"!"

"Remember... that the world... is bigger than you think..."

Olivia grabbed Ellen's wrist, which was holding her own collar, while smiling brightly as if it was effortless.

Olivia then opened Ellen's hand with just her grip.

Ellen was the strongest among the first-year students, and was recognized as a monster outside the norm among us.

Even though she was a senior, everyone was amazed as Ellen was pushed back by Olivia's strength. After letting go of Ellen's hand, Olivia adjusted her clothes and grinned.

-pop!

Olivia poked Ellen's forehead with her index finger, startling her. "You may be confident, but there will always be someone better than you. Keep that in mind."

Ellen stared at Olivia with wide eyes.

"If you don’t want to participate in Miss Temple, why don’t we face off at the unlimited tournament? Whether it's Miss Temple or the tournament, I’m confident I can win at either, alright?"

Olivia left Ellen, who was rendered speechless, and winked at me before leaving the classroom.

Ellen just stood there, staring at the door that Olivia had left through. Everyone alternated between looking at Ellen and me, surprised by the event just now.

"There was a time when I was jealous of that guy..."

"He’ll never have a peaceful life, that’s for sure..."

Erich and Cayer muttered under their breath.

Kono Lint patted my shoulder.

"Well... cheer up."

I never thought I'd get sympathy from this bastard.

No matter how strong I became, I still couldn't compare to Ellen, who was undoubtedly strong. And then there was Olivia Lanze, who was clearly strong, even compared to Ellen.

Everyone seemed to imagine that I would end up being crushed like a shrimp among these formidable humans.

Anyway...

Hey sis.

Can you see this?

I’m in trouble.

* * *

A little later.

"I told you to stop bothering that kid who's just minding her own business!"

"Mmm, I'm sorry, I won't do it again!"

I eventually made it up to the fifth year classroom, where my temper exploded and I gave Olivia a piece of my mind.

"Are you sure you wanna go all the way? Do it! Show me. Come on, show me you bastard!"

"Reinhardt! I was too harsh! Yeah, I'll apologize! Should I apologize to her?"

"Forget the apology and just leave her alone! Do you want to keep me up all night? Huh?"

"Yeah! I'll leave her alone!"

The situation was the same as before, despite being a different year level.

All the other fifth-year seniors were just staring blankly as the grumpy underclassman held onto their classmate like a vice.

In the end, I managed to make Olivia cry and beg for forgiveness.

I hadn't expected her to tear up a little, so I was a little embarrassed.
