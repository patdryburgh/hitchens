Chapter 301

He could not show it.

“Show us! Show us!”

Kono Lint wanted to bite his tongue and die as he looked at the people in front of him who were egging him on.

'Are you crazy?!'

The host didn't know anything about his supernatural ability, but thought it was something great and so urged him onward, along with the audience who were excited to see the supernatural ability of teleportation firsthand from a Royal Class student.

If he actually teleported and ended up only in his underwear, the worst case scenario would be the entire auditorium turning up into a mess, but in the best case, he’d still end up as a laughingstock.

There was a serious flaw in his ability. Therefore, he cannot show it.

He had to speak up. It's already embarrassing enough to be in this state in front of people, and he didn't want to do anything that would make it even more humiliating.

People wanted to see a flashy teleportation show where he would appear from one place to another, but what they would actually see was a picture of a dangerous pervert wearing only his underwear hopping around, so his course was clear!

This was it.

He had to say it.

“Show us! Show us!”

Kono Lint hears the shouts and sees and the gazes directed towards him.

Even as he stood there in that silly dress, he could feel their gazes on him.

It was the gaze of envy.

That was a gaze that Kono Lint had never gotten before. 

Just the name "Royal Class" alone brought out the subtle jealousy, envy, and longing of those who saw it.

But the boy has never experienced something like that before.

Within the Royal Class, having nothing that separated you from the masses was considered a disadvantage, and was discriminated against for a long time.

‘Yay! That's awesome!’

‘Isn't it just a matter of time before you can move your clothes with them?’

‘Congra, con, congratulations Lint…’

When he was able to move with his underwear, his fellow supernatural ability users rejoiced with him.

It's the kind of pathetic ability that gets cheered and praised just for being less pathetic.

He couldn't even dream of doing anything like Reinhardt did, getting away with crazy things and rising to prominence.

Awaking a supernatural ability during a fight with a senior.

Returning from the Darklands after doing something unbelievable.

Learning Magic Body Strengthening in the middle of a fight.

Winning confidently in the first-year tournament.

All those things.

It's not his role to surprise people and make everyone's jaws drop.

But now, people were watching him.

Just because he was in the Royal Class, just because he had a supernatural ability. 

Even more, there were girls who were murmuring how cute he was.

For the first time his my life, he received attention. What would happen, if he were to tell them that he couldn’t use his ability because he’d be stripped out of his clothes.There were useless guys like him in the Royal Class too.

Would it change the way they saw him?

Just imagining their excited gazes turning into cold ones filled him with pain.

A useless ability.

No, it's an incredible ability, but it's impractical due to its significant flaw.

When would he be able to stop living like this?

Did he have to live with small improvements, waiting to see the next thing he could carry along after underwear?

When would he become a useful person?

The cries of the people felt distant to Kono Lint. The host's laughter sounded like a far away echo.

Amidst all the attention of countless people, Kono Lint felt alone.

He didn’t want to become like Reinhardt.

That foolish bastard selectively pursues only the most dangerous endeavours, and succeeds as much as he risks.

He didn’t want to live like that. He didn’t think he even could.

He couldn’t live like that handsome but unlucky delinquent that always chased after danger.

But still, if it’s just a little bit.

If the world could be generous towards that guy.

Maybe it could be generous to me too.

Until when did he have to live a life where he introduced himself as a supernatural ability user, but never actually being able to use it?

At the very least, there was one thing he learned from Reinhardt. Sometimes recklessness brought about results.

Recklessness doesn't necessarily bring failure.

He was envious.

Maybe there was something out there for him as well.

But he knew this much at least, it wouldn’t come to him if he made no effort to reach it.

If you don't take the risk of climbing the fruit bearing tree, its fruit will never be yours.

“Show us!”

After that brief period of contemplation that felt like a lifetime, Kono Lint regained his sense of reality.

The boy has made his decision.

The Royal Class students who had been laughing at him up until that point, were now turning white. They had read something in that boy's determined expression.

“No! Don’t do it!”

Especially Liana de Grantz, who was having the most fun at first, who now shook her head and shouted that he should stop. She may enjoy a little bit of teasing, but she wasn’t a bad person by nature.

She desperately tried to prevent him from crossing a river from which there was no way back.

‘No.’

But right now, Kono Lint was not in a state where he could hear anyone's voices.

He decided to do it.

There are times when he must move forward, even if he failed.

“Show us, oppa!”

It wasn’t because of the cute middle school girls giggling in the front seat.

“Mr. Lint, if it's difficult to demonstrate, you could show us something else.…”

It's not because of the host that is one sidedly chattering beside him either.

“Show us!”

Not even because of the envious gazes of the countless people before him.

“Stop! Lint!”

It was not for anyone else.

It was for himself.

He was fed up with this mediocrity, of he who was resigned to this stagnation. 

That's why, even though he couldn’t live like Reinhardt, he had decided to live his life like that person would just this once.

There are situations where you cannot retreat, and this was one of them.

Pushing oneself to the limit. and then move on to the next level.

If you fail, you will be a total disgrace.

If you succeed, you don't have to live like a loser anymore.

This was the moment that would define him.

I will do it because I have to do it.

“I'll show you something.”

“Wahhhhhh!”

Kono Lint, who was currently wearing a dress, became more serious than any other time in his life..

I will teleport my clothes with me and complete the teleportation, and then I will finally walk the path of a true supernatural ability user.

The target of the teleportation was the right side of the stage.

Using the ability itself was easy.

It's just that he didn’t know how to deal with the downside.

Although he had no idea where to start, he will finally overcome this weakness and achieve the pinnacle of teleportation with his own hands.

“Ha!”

Kono Lint put his hands together and took a stance.

-Pak!

“Oh!”

Instantaneously.

Silence fell over the auditorium.

Kono Lint had succeeded in teleportation.

“Uh…?”

The audience was amazed.

“Huh...?”

Even the moderator was astonished.

“Huh…?”

“What, what is it...?”

And his classmates who had been watching the situation were equally dumbfounded. It wasn't the look of those who had seen the inevitable outcome, but a look of shock caused by seeing something completely unexpected.

“…?”

And it was the same for  Kono Lint, who was also stunned and at a loss for words.

Clearly, Kono Lint succeeded in teleportation.

But his body was still there, on the same spot.

It was his clothes that had moved.

Kono Lint moved all of his clothes except for his underwear to the right side of the stage.

Kono Lint was dumbfounded.

And so were his classmates.

Kono Lint's ability had evolved.

What just happened was unbelievable. But for those who were aware of the limits of Kono Lint’s ability, they had realized that this result had surpassed all expectations and achieved something akin to a miracle.

“So… this is what they call teleportation?”

“Um, well... um. No.”

However, everyone who were watching, including the host, could only assume that Kono Lint's ability to teleport was always like this.

Instead of moving himself, he moved the clothes he was wearing

Kono Lint achieved miraculous growth in his ability.

“Kyaaaaaah!”

However.

Suddenly, being naked except for his underwear was ultimately the same thing.



* * *



“Well, that was contestant number one Kono Lint!”

Kono Lint fled to the back of the stage, and it took a while for the confusion of the many students and audience members, who were caught off guard by the sudden turn of events, to settle down.

"What did I... What did I just see...?"

Liana de Grantz murmured in disbelief.

It was partly due to Kono Lint's sudden appearance in his underwear, but it was also, of course, due to the fact that Kono Lint had used his ability in a way not seen before.

Heinrich, Cayer, and Erich were also taken aback.

People's shocked and exaggerated reactions towards Kono Lint's ability were unavoidable since they didn't know much about him.

After all, the concept of teleportation didn’t necessarily imply that the subject of teleportation was the person holding the ability.

However, to those who knew him, they were amazed that Kono Lint, who previously could only move his body, had successfully teleported an object.

As a result, even though it was only the clothes that were teleported and the whole thing ended up looking ridiculous, it's safe to say that the ability itself had evolved considerably.

Those who were unaware of the truth had expressions of shock and disbelief. Others found it cute when Kono Lint, who was bewildered, ran away.

But the four who knew the truth stood there with their mouths agape, unable to say anything for a while.



* * *



“Alright, now let's introduce the next contestant number 2!”

The host started to proceed with the competition in an attempt to restore order.

Since these four were here to see Kono Lint's ridiculous appearance in the first place, now that it’s over, there was no need for them to stay here.

Of course, there was the matter of voting for the winner after all the contestants had been introduced. However that wasn’t something they were required to do.

There was a shocking result, but since the important business was over, there's no reason to stay put.

However, those four still hadn’t stood up and left. It wasn’t just them, a lot of the audience stuck around and continued watching.

“What do you have in store for your appeal?”

“I'm going to show you a dance.”

The participants' silly antics were so amusing that they continued to watch. Some participated as a punishment and some were voluntarily there, but they were all quite funny in their own way.

"Hey, what is that? What is it?"

"Ack! Ack! If it's funny, why are you hitting me!"

Despite being shocked by Kono Lint's show earlier, right now Liana couldn't resist laughing and smacking Erich de Lafaeri, who was sitting next to her.

"Couldn't you have shaved your legs before coming? Ew!"

Liana laughed as she slapped the person next to her.

"This is crazy... Oh, my stomach hurts."

There was dancing, singing, and combat demonstrations for the appeal.

One contestant, a music major who looked pretty damn good in women’s clothes, nailed a soulful baritone solo that had everyone clapping along.

After a while of this, Liana clapped her hands as if she'd remembered something.

“Oh right!”

“Well, what's right... You gonna hit me again?”

Seeing the glint in Liana's eyes, as if she had just remembered something, Erich shrunk back as if he had had enough.

“That's right! That's right! You know what!”

-Slap!

Of course, she really hit him again.

“Ah, why do you keep hitting me….”

After slapping Erich's shoulder a few times, Liana spoke while looking at the three idiots(one substituted).

"Earlier, in the waiting room, there was this weird kid."

"Weird kid?"

Erich repeats, and Cayer's expression turns strange.

“Is there anyone there who doesn't look weird? Because that would be even weirder, right...?”

That's true enough.

In a room full of cross-dressing men, someone who didn’t seem strange at all would stand out as even stranger. In a place where strange people are normal, the normal ones are the odd ones out.

"No, there was a girl who was really pretty!"

Liana chose a rough expression after much deliberation.

“…?”

“…?”

“…?”

Liana used an intense expression to describe how stunning the girl was.

Of course, if she were in the waiting room it must be a man. Liana remembered the strange person she had forgotten about due to the shock earlier, and tilted her head.

“It was around number 40, I think.”

Liana was curious enough to stay until then, and her classmates became curious as well when Liana spoke up like that.

How pretty was she?

It was just curiosity, that's all.

If a man cross-dresses and looks that good, what could you even say?

They didn't understand why all three of them were still sitting there, but for now they didn't get up from their seats.

"Now, let me introduce contestant number 24, Mr. Richard Haulman!"

“…”

“…”

“…”

The appearance of the giant in a dress that was more than two meters tall made everyone want to cover their eyes, even the moderator looked incredulous.

“...It makes me want to leave.”

Liana’s lip twitched at the edges, she had saw him earlier in the waiting room, but had ignored him

“Hmm, let's see. Um...... Ah, oof. Um. Well. Yes. Oh.”

It was clear that it would be an even more unpleasant sight to see a muscular, coarse-looking man blushing and crossing his legs while fiddling with the hem of his dress.

After a hilarious exchange between the exasperated host and the embarrassed human tank, the host decided it was time to move on and went straight to the appeal.

“What did you prepare for the appeal?”

“I will demonstrate squats for you.”

Everyone watched in morbid fascination as the human tank suddenly demonstrated a high-weight squat while wearing a dress.

The sight was so unpleasant in many ways that it caused many people to leave the place.

Amidst all the excitement and laughter, the cross-dressing contest had finally reached the final stretch.

“Now, we are about to welcome the final participant of the highly anticipated 8th cross-dressing contest. This last participant is sure to surprise you in many ways.”

“Since he has requested to stay anonymous, we cannot disclose his real name. But, please welcome contestant number 40!”

Contestant no. 40 wasn’t the only one who requested to stay anonymous. There were quite a number of other participants that wished to remain unknown, so that wasn’t weird at all.

Liana had already seen contestant no. 40 before, and the other three onlookers were curious since Liana mentioned her.

Here came the final contestant.

She slowly stepped onto the stage.

“Woah….”

The audience's reaction to the 40th participant walking out under the spotlight were just a series of gasps of amazement.

“What, what is this...?”

“No….”

“What… How could it be?”

The reactions of the Royal Class students weren't much different. Even Liana, who had seen it once before, was staring absentmindedly at contestant number 40, her face frozen in shock.

Silver hair shimmered brilliantly under the lights. Though it was surely a wig, it looked so lively and animated that it could have been mistaken for her real hair.

Golden irises, alluring and clear pink lips, a beautiful jawline and forehead, and a clean and slender white neck.

Slender shoulders that were not prominent, and a perfect waist that was hidden by the hem of the dress.

There was a gentle and kind-looking smile on her face.

Therefore, the same question inevitably came to everyone's mind.

That's a man?

It's a lie.

“He, he... I hate to say it, but... Are you a cross-dressing contestant?”

“Yes.”

A voice with a subtle androgynous charm.

Everyone was frozen in shock rather than cheering or exclaiming in admiration. It was as though they were questioning the validity of what they were seeing.

“You requested to keep your identity a secret, is there a reason for that?”

The expression of contestant no. 40 cracked for a brief moment, but she quickly regained her composure.

“...Well, everyone has secrets, don't they?”

“I see... Do you usually dress like this?”

“....”

At the host's provocative words, contestant no. 40 stared at the moderator for a moment.

Just then, everyone saw a brief flicker on contestant no.40’s expression, but no one saw it clearly. In an instant, contestant no. 40 recovered her smile and spoke brightly.

“No, not at all.”

“You mean this is your first time?”

“Yes.”

It looked fine, but the audience were watching closely.

Despite her facial expression, a charming smile that revealed nothing, contestant no. 40 was fiddling with the hem of her dress.

It was clear that she was very tense. Her face was also getting redder by the second and it was clear that she was very embarrassed about all this.
